This PDDL file defines a domain with the following entities and actions:

*   `lantern-of-light`: The domain itself.
*   `adventurer`, `spectral-wolf`, `granda-mira`, `valdombra`, `misty-woods`, `lighthouse`, `moon-key`, and `lantern-of-light` are the types in the domain.
*   Various predicates define relationships between entities, such as whether an adventurer is at a certain location or whether a wolf hinders entry to a lighthouse. Predicates like `has-moon-key` and `has-lantern` indicate that an entity has the moon key or lantern, respectively.
*   The following actions are defined:

    *   `open-doors`: Opens the door of a lighthouse with the presence of a moon key.
    *   `avoid-wolf`: Avoids a wolf if it's present at a location where entry to a lighthouse is hindered.
    *   `find-key`: Finds a key in a specified location, assuming the adventurer has the required moon key.
    *   `move-to`: Moves an entity to a new location while avoiding the wolf and other obstacles.
    *   `enter-lighthouse`: Enters a lighthouse if the adventurer possesses the moon key.
    *   `navigate-traps`: Navigates through traps inside a lighthouse, recovering the lantern if necessary.
    *   `recover-lantern`: Recovers the lantern from within the lighthouse.
    *   `end-adventure`: Ends an adventure once the lantern is recovered and the darkness is removed.

The initial state of the problem includes facts about the presence of entities at specific locations, obstacles in certain places, and the lack or absence of essential items. The goal of the problem is to recover the lantern of light by recovering it from within a lighthouse.
