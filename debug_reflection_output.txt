The PDDL files provided are syntactically correct. However, they might not produce a valid plan if the problem's initial state is incorrect or some actions are missing from the domain file. 

For instance, in the current problem setup, there is no action defined for "hiding-in" and "contained-within". Also, it seems like there should be a different predicate to represent the Wolf being hostile, not using "hostile-to" which might not exist in PDDL.

But as you provided all the required details, here's an example of how one could define these missing actions:

New domain:
```lisp
(:action 
 :parameters (?obj - object ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?obj ?loc1) (not (lighthouse-sealed ?loc1)))
 :effect (when (at ?obj ?loc2) (not (carrying ?agent)) (not (lighthouse-sealed ?loc2)) (lighthouse-sealed ?loc1) (not (wolf-in-location ?loc2))))
(:action 
 :parameters (?agent - object ?key - object ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?agent ?loc) (carrying ?agent ?key) (has-key ?agent))
 :effect (when (not (at ?key ?loc)) (lighthouse-sealed ?loc)))
(:action 
 :parameters (?agent - object ?lantern - object ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (carrying ?agent ?lantern) (lantern-inside ?loc))
 :effect (when (not (at ?lantern ?loc)) (not (trap ?lantern))))
(:action 
 :parameters (?agent - object ?key - object ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
 :precondition (and (at ?agent ?loc1) (has-key ?agent ?key))
 :effect (when (at ?agent ?loc2) (not (carrying ?agent ?key))))
(:action 
 :parameters (?agent - object ?trap - object ?loc - location)
 :precondition (and (carrying ?agent ?trap) (trap ?trap))
 :effect (when (not (at ?trap ?loc)) (not (trap ?trap)))))
```
New problem:
```lisp
(define 
(:domain lantern-of-light)
(:objects
you - person
valdombra - village
mistywoods - forest
oldlighthouse - building
grandmamira - person
spectralwolf - creature
lanternoflight - object
moonkey - key)
(:init
(at you valdombra)
(has-key you)
(hiding ?moonkey mistywoods)
(can-open oldlighthouse ?moonkey)
(contained-within oldlighthouse lanternoflight)
(hostile-to spectralwolf valdombra)
(hidden-by grandmamira mistywoods))
(:goal
(and
(banish-darkness valdombra)
(have-key you))))
```
Please replace the "hiding" and "contained-within" with appropriate actions from your domain file. Also, note that there is no `disarm-trap` action in your current problem or domain. You may need to define this as well depending on how traps are defined in your domain. 

Remember, the planner must be able to solve the planning problem with these actions and predicates to generate a valid plan. If no solution can be found even after defining all missing actions, you might have to revise or adjust other parts of your PDDL files (e.g., goals). 

Note: The given code snippets are only illustrative examples and would need to be adjusted according to the actual definitions in your domain file before they can produce a valid plan.
